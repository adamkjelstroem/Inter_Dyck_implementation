# Inter_Dyck_implementation


to run implementation of the first attempt at an n3 version, do:

python3 np_impl.py input.txt

NOTE: this uses a /very/ inefficient Dyck reachability algorithm, making it much too slow to be useful.
DO NOT attempt to run this on actual benchmarks, as it consumes too much memory.
